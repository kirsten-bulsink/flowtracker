<!-- badges: start -->

This is my toy package which I created during the R packages course 
of the escience center. The package makes it possible to compare dataframes 
on different properties (nr of columns, nr of rows, colnames) and to evaluate 
if this meets your expectation. This enables insight into the data tranformation 
process. It creates a possibility to check that the transformation gives the 
expected result and no unexpected behavior is introduced. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of flowtracker like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("kirsten-bulsink/flowtracker", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
